# Etch-a-Sketch

1. By default, the Etch-a-Sketch grid is 16 × 16.
2. You can click the button to set a custom grid size (up to 100 × 100).
3. Hovering over a square applies a random color.
4. Each time you hover over the same square, its opacity increases by 0.1 — making the random color more visible, until it becomes fully opaque (opacity = 1).
